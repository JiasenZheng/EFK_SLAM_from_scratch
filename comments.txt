   - Rviz screenshot

roslaunch nuturtle_description load.launch
[only works for black. You need to pass an argument changing the fixed
frame in rviz and launch rviz in the correct namespace to make it work for all colors] -1

Task B.
     [added public members to transform2d] -1
     static_assertions?
     unit_tests (enough + passed?)
[Some of my tests failed, related to IO rather than computation] -1
/// Test 1
    stringstream ss2;
    ss2 << "45 -1 7";
    ss2 >> tfin;
    CHECK(tfin.rotation() == Approx(PI/4.0));
    CHECK(tfin.translation().x == Approx(-1));
    CHECK(tfin.translation().y == Approx(7));
// TEST 2
    const auto v = Vector2D{1.0, 3.0};

Code works?
     conceptual questions [Classes and structs are identical.  The geeksforgeeks article you cited is actually incorrect, be careful with that website.
                           see inline for details.] (No points off, since you cited a source)

Task C.
   roslaunch nusim.launch
   clock is published?
   [ This does not seem to incrementing at each simulation timestep, but rather once a second or something]
   teleport works? [ it works, but it is called telep instead of teleport] -1 
   reset works?
