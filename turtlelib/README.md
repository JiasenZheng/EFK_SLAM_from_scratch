# Turtlelib Library
A library for handling transformations in SE(2) and other turtlebot-related math.

# Components
- rigid2d - Handles 2D rigid body transformations
- frame_main - Perform some rigid body computations based on user input

# Conceptual Questions
1. We need to be able to ~normalize~ Vector2D objects (i.e., find the unit vector in the direction of a given Vector2D):
   - Propose three different designs for implementing the ~normalize~ functionality

   - Discuss the pros and cons of each proposed method, in light of the C++ Core Guidelines.

   - Which of the methods would you implement and why?

2. What is the difference between a class and a struct in C++?


3. Why is Vector2D a struct and Transform2DClass (refer to at least 2 specific C++ core guidelines in your answer)?


4. Why are some of the constructors in Transform2D explicit (refer to a specific C++ core guideline in your answer)?


5. Why is Transform2D::inv() declared const while Transform2D::operator*=() is not?
